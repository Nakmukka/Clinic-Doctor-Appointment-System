## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

# Doctor Appointment Booking System

This project is a web-based Doctor Appointment Booking System built with Laravel, aimed at simplifying the process of booking, managing, and tracking medical appointments. It features two main modules: a **User Module** and an **Admin Module**, each providing a set of functionalities tailored to different roles.

## Features

### User Module

- **Book Appointment**: Users can book an appointment for the current day by filling in the required details. Their name and phone number are auto-filled from their profile, making the process fast and easy.
- **Appointment Management**: Once booked, users can view their appointment details on the main page, including confirmation status and any notes from the doctor.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated with Razorpay for online payments. Once a doctor confirms the appointment, users can proceed with payment. The status updates to “Paid” upon successful transaction completion.

### Admin Module
- **Admin Login**: A secure login page with predefined credentials, allowing authorized personnel to access the admin dashboard.
- **Dashboard**: The dashboard provides a quick overview of appointments, including the total appointments and today’s bookings.
- **Appointment Management**: Admins can view all appointments with patient details like name, blood type, date, time, and health condition.
